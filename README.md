Pyannote is an AI tool which diarizes the audio and video streams whilst also segmenting the audio in to discrete chunks according to speaker. The code authors have made this software open source, but have some terms and conditions which you need to agree to in order to use the code. It will not be possible to use these scripts without following these processes, so please don't skip these actions
